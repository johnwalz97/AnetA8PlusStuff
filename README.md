# Anet A8 Plus Board - v1.7

Board definition, schematics, et. al. for reverse engineering the Anet A8 Plus v1.7 board so I can squeeze everything out of it before
upgrading to something like 32bit ARM/RiscV. I had to burn a bootloader onto the board and then load the klipper firware (modified) onto it as well. Also had to figure out the board layout so I could solder in tmc2209 stepper drivers which were a super big upgrade from the shitty a4988 that comes with. More mods to come.
